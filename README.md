The replication script for Marten van Schijndel, William Schuler, and Peter Culicover. "Frequency Effects in the Processing of Unbounded Dependencies." In Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2014). 2014.

Essentially shows that psycholinguistic norming studies based on cloze probabilities are insufficient frequency controls. Demonstrates how to combine cloze probabilities and corpus statistics to better predict behavioral data. This very simple approach is able to account for a number of previous subcategorization results.
